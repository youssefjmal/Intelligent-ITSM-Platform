# Scrum Artifacts

This folder contains lightweight Scrum artifacts for the project.

## Files

- `product-backlog.md`: ordered list of product backlog items.

2. During sprint planning, move selected items to `sprint-backlog.md`.
3. Track stories and acceptance criteria in `user-stories.md`.
4. Validate each completed item against `definition-of-done.md`.
